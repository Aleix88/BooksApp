## Requirements and Specs
### User Stories
**Narrative #1**

As a online user, I want to be able to enter the name of a book or author in the search bar and scroll through all the results.

**Scenarios**

Given an online user

When the user enters text in the search bar and clicks on search

Then the app should display the remote results based on the input

And those books that they already read should be checked.

**Narrative #2**

As an online user, I want to be able to select a book from my previous search to add it to my list of read books.

**Scenarios**

Given an online user

When the user makes a search and selects a book from that list

Then that book is added to their "read list"

**Narrative #3**

As a user, I want to be able to access my list of read books.

**Scenarios**

Given a user

When they demand the read book list

Then the current list is fetched from local and displayed.
